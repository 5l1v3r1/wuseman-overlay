Cloud Station Drive is an application designed to synchronize files between your Synology NAS and PCs via the Internet, 
ensuring that your data is always up-to-date and enabling you to easily access your files. Even when the Internet connection is not available, 
you can still view and edit your files offline, and all the changes made will be automatically synced to your Synology NAS and PCs once the Internet connection is restored.
